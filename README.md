An application that showcases various tourist attractions in Newcastle with the help of **Flutter and Dart programming**. 

Users should be able to see what open attractions are nearby (i.e., a maximum radius of 1 mile from their current location) by using a map as well as an option to show attractions nearby as a list.

# Basic Requirements
The implemented system should have the following functionality

• Show open tourist attractions within a 1-mile radius using a map view as well as a list.

• Allow the user to filter what attractions are displayed (I.e., historical buildings, museums, libraries and parks)

• When the user selects a particular attraction, display:

o How far (in yards or metres) the attraction is from the user’s current location

o Links to online photos of the attraction

o Information on opening times (if applicable)

o Admission costs (if applicable)

o Approximate walking times

These requirements should be refined into a set of deliverables by your team. It is expected
that teams will deliver all basic requirements.

# Assumptions
• While the application is focused on Newcastle, it should be easy to adapt to another city or location.

• The app should be optimised for mobile phones.

• The app will show at least one picture of each attraction.
